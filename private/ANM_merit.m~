% Input:
% network0  matrix [n,3] of coordinates of network points (knots) of the 
%           original structure
% target    target structure
%
% Output:
% overlap       vector of overlap of the normal modes with the structural 
%               change (Tama & Sanejouand, 2001, Eq. (2))
%               cumulative overlap        :  sqrt(cumsum(overlap.^2))
%               mode with largest overlap :  [maxovl,modenum]=max(overlap)
% correlation   vector of correlation of the normal modes with the
%               structural change (Tama & Sanejouand, 2001, Eq. (3))
% collectivity  collectivity of the structural change (Tama & Sanejouand,
%               2001, Eq. (4); originally: Brüschweiler, 1995)
% rmsd          r.m.s.d. between the two structures (C_alpha)
