<div class="subtitle">About MMM</div>
<p>
Displays information on version and authors of MMM.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Credits</div>
<p>
Acknowledges open-source software used in development of MMM, authors of modules, and advice.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">License</div>
<p>
The general open-source license conditions that apply to MMM and all open-source software from other authors that was included into MMM. By using MMM you agree to the terms of this license.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Third-party software</div>
<p>
Explains how to install third-party software that is not bundled with MMM (for licensing reasons), but is used for some functionality (because it is so good). Generally we consider only third-party software that is free for academic use and sufficiently well documented.
</p>
<a name="bug_report">
<div class="subtitle">Create bug report</div>
<p>
Helps to report a bug in MMM to the program authors. The bug report contains information on the version of MMM, the Matlab version, the computer (Windows, 64-bit Windows, Linux, Mac) 
and on all output to the Matlab command window since the start of the session, which includes Matlab error messages. Unless you have actively switched off session logging, the report also contains
all output to the message board and all issued commands (input into the command line and commands automatically generated by MMM subroutines).
</p>
<p>
The bug report ist opened in MMM's report editor (usually as read-only) and an e-mail to the MMM authors is prepared by opening your system's mailtool with their e-mail address.
Nothing is sent automatically.
</p>
<p>
Please specify a subject line for the mail (we appreciate MMM bug: <i>task</i>, where <i>task</i> describes what you wanted to do). Please give a bit additional information
and copy the error report from the report editor window into the e-mail (or attach the log file).
</p>
<p>
Note that a log file may contain sensitive information about the project you are working on. If you don't want us to see certain things, please delete them manually 
from the log text before you sent the mail. 
If you switch off logging right at the beginning of the session, only version information and error information is contained in the error report. 
In many, but not all cases, this will be sufficient to find the bug.
Please include at least the final section of a bug report:
<p>
<code>BUG> follows the output into the Matlab command window:</code>
<p>
and
<p>
<code>BUG>--- end of Matlab command window output ---</code>
