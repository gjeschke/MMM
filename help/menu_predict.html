<div class="subtitle">CD spectrum</div>
<p>
Opens a Matlab browser displaying a Web server that allows for CD spectrum prediction from a PDB file. Note that only standard amino acids, not cofactors, are considered in this computation. Save your structure as a PDB file and upload this PDB file to the server. Results will be sent by e-mail. The server is courtesy of The Hirst group, University of Nottingham.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Secondary</div>
<p>
Offers access to several Web servers for prediction of secondary structure from amino acid sequence. These servers are:
<ul>
<li>PHYRE, courtesy Structural Bioinformatics Group, Imperial College, London
<li>PSIPRED, courtesy Bioinformatics Group, University College London 
<li>SAM, courtesy Bioinformatics, UC Santa Cruz
<li>PORTER, courtesy University College, Dublin
<li>SABLE, courtesy University of Cincinnati 
</ul> 
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Tertiary</div>
<p>
Offers access to several Web servers and a program for prediction of tertiary structure from amino acid sequence. These servers are:
<ul>
<li>HHpred, courtesy Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen
<li>PHYRE, courtesy Structural Bioinformatics Group, Imperial College, London
<li>SAM, courtesy Bioinformatics, UC Santa Cruz
</ul> 
</p>
<a name="quaternary">
<div class="subtitle">Quaternary</div>
<p>
Offers access to <a href="docking.html">MMMDock</a>, a constraint-based rigid-body docking module of MMM, and to the HADDOCK Web server. An EPR-constraint based HADDOCK version is under development by Morgan Bye (Norwich) and will be linked when publicly available. The server is:

</ul> 
</p>
<div class="subtitle">TM topology</div>
<p>
Offers access to several Web servers for prediction of transmembrane topology from amino acid sequence. Unlike tertiary structure prediction this works quite well even if no structure for a similar integral membrane protein is known. The servers are:
<ul>
<li>MEMSAT3 (via PSIPRED), courtesy Bioinformatics Group, University College London
<li>TMHMM, courtesy Center for Biological Sequence Ananysis, Technical University of Denmark
<li>PHILIUS, courtesy Yeast Resource Center, University of Washington
</ul> 
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Disorder</div>
<p>
Offers access to a Web server for prediction of disordered domains of a protein from the sequence:
<ul>
<li>Spritz, courtesy University College Dublin and University of Padua
</ul> 
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Hinges</div>
<p>
Offers access to Web servers for prediction of hinges that allow for relative movement of protein domains. A PDB file must be uploaded. The servers are:
<ul>
<li>StoneHinge, courtesy Yale University
<li>HingeMaster, courtesy Yale University
</ul> 
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Domains</div>
<p>
Offers access to a Web server for prediction of conserved domains of a protein from the sequence:
<ul>
<li>NCBI conserved domains, courtesy NCBI
</ul> 
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Toolboxes</div>
<p>
Offers access to a Web page that lists a lot of protein prediction and analysis software (no longer updated, but still very useful):
<ul>
