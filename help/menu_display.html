<a name="view_selection">
<div class="subtitle">View selection</div>
<p>
Zoom camera to the selected objects. To further enhance a detail view, you may use emulated <a href"depth_cueing.html">depth cueing</a> (button in the <a href="view_control.html">view panel</a>).
</p>
<div class="subtitle">View whole model</div>
<p>
Sets camera properties so that the whole model is seen.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Hierarchy</div>
<p>
Open the <a href="hierarchy_window.html">hierarchy window</a> for object selection, editing of secondary structure, and sequence display.
</p>
<a name="color">
<div class="subtitle">Color</div>
<p>
Assign color (by name or from palette) or color scheme to selected objects (see <a href="color_selection.html">color selection window</a>).
</p>
<a name"transparency">
<div class="subtitle">Transparency</div>
<p>
Assign transparency to selected objects (see <a href="transparency_selection.html">transparency selection window</a>).
</p>
<a name="3D">
<div class="subtitle">3D display mode</div>
<p>
Assign a 3D display mode (e.g. wire, stick, space-filling, ribbon, string) to selected objects (see <a href="graphics_window.html">graphics mode window</a>).
</p>
<a name="density">
<div class="subtitle">Density</div>
<p>
Control display of density cubes. A dialog appears that allows to select the density cube from a list of all previously loaded data sets (see <a href="menu_file.html#density">File menu help</a> for how to load density cubes).
</p>
<p>
The contour level is relative to the range of the density data and can vary between 0 and 1. It can be changed by direct input of the number or with a slider; the two controls are coupled. By default data are normalized to the density integral. At a level of 0.8 then and isosurface is drawn that includes 80% of all density. In this mode, larger levels correspond to larger density clouds.
</p>
<p>
If the <code>normalize to integral</code> checkbox is deactivated, data are normalized to maximum density. At a level of 0.8 then only voxels are shown that have at least 80% of the maximum density. In this mode, larger levels correspind to smaller density clouds.
</p>
<p>
In both modes, a level &ge; 0.999 suppresses display. This can also be used to hide a previously displayed density cube.
<p>
Transparency of the density cloud can be specified between 0 (invisible) and 1 (opaque). Opaque looks most impressive if nothing inside the cloud needs to be seen. Otherwise the default value of 0.5 (semi-transparent) is usually a good compromise.
</p>
<p>
The color of the density cloud can be specified via a palette by using the <code>Color</code>.
</p>
<p>
Density display resets the camera view so that all displayed objects are seen.
</p>
The density surface is also assigned an address <code>$density:<i>tag</i></code>, where <i>tag</i> is the tag provide above. The surface is known by this address to the <a href="commands.html#show">show</a>, <a href="commands.html#hide">hide</a>, <a href="commands.html#color">color</a>, and <a href="commands.html#transparency">transparency</a> commands, which affect only the visualization, but not the underlying data. By using the <a href="commands.html#delete">delete</a> command, both the surface and the underlying data are deleted. If the surface is to be redisplayed later, the density data have to be <a href="menu_file.html#density">reloaded</a>.  
<p>
<i>Examples:</i>
<p>
<code>color $density:spin aliceblue</code> % changes color of the density cloud with tag "spin" to a very pale blue
<p>
<code>hide $density:spin</code> % hides the surface with tag "spin"
<p>
<code>show $density:spin</code> % redisplays the surface with tag "spin" after being hidden, this is fast, no recomputation required
<p>
<code>delete $density:spin</code> % deletes the surface with tag "spin" and the underlying data
<p>
The last command frees the memory and storage space of the density cube, which may be substantial.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Depth cueing</div>
<p>
Switch on emulated depth cueing to obtain a "more 3D" impression (see <a href"depth_cueing.html">depth cueing description</a>).
</p>
<a name="localization">
<div class="subtitle">Localization</div>
<p>
Displays possible locations of a spin label with respect to a reference structure as an isoprobability surface. The localization can also be presented as an ensemble of pseudo-atoms at possible spin label localizations and can be saved into a PDB file in that way. See <a href="localization.html">Spin label localization</a> for detailed explanation.
